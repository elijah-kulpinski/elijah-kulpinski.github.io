    <section id="about-me">
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am a dedicated data science enthusiast with a deep-seated passion for unraveling complex datasets and extracting actionable insights. My academic foundation is solidly rooted in software engineering and mathematics, allowing me to approach data challenges with a unique blend of precision and creativity. Beyond the numbers, I thrive in collaborative environments, drawing on diverse perspectives to enrich analysis and decision-making processes.</p>

        <p>Throughout my career, I've embraced various leadership roles, from coordinating emergency medical responses to fostering academic excellence among peers. These experiences have not only sharpened my leadership and communication skills but have also instilled a profound sense of responsibility and empathy in my professional demeanor.</p>

        <p>As I edge closer to completing my Master's degree in Computer Information Systems with a focus on Data Science, I'm eager to contribute to projects and initiatives that leverage big data to foster innovation and drive progress. I am particularly drawn to opportunities that allow for the application of machine learning models and advanced statistical techniques to solve real-world problems.</p>

        <p>Let's connect if you share a zeal for data-driven discoveries and a commitment to excellence in the tech industry. I'm always on the lookout for collaborative projects and professional networking opportunities.</p>

            <!-- Project 1: Parkside Website Assistant -->
            <li>
                <h3>Parkside Website Assistant</h3>
                <p>As the project lead for the Parkside Website Assistant initiative, my team and I sought to enhance the digital experience for students and faculty at the University of Wisconsin-Parkside. Recognizing the challenges of navigating extensive online resources, we developed an AI-powered chatbot designed to streamline information retrieval and improve website accessibility. This endeavor involved meticulous dataset curation, combining web scraping techniques with manual data synthesis to train a bespoke Language Learning Model (LLM). Utilizing cutting-edge tools such as Firebase for real-time database management, WebLLM for integrating large language models in web environments, and Qdrant as a vector search engine, we successfully deployed a client-side model that significantly improved query response accuracy and user interaction quality.</p>

            <!-- Project 2: Empowering Education Research -->
            <li>
                <h3>Empowering Education Research</h3>
                <p>Leading the Empowering Education Research project was a pivotal moment in my academic career, allowing me to bridge the gap between artificial intelligence and educational methodologies. The project's core ambition was to personalize the learning experience in computer science education through the integration of Language Learning Models (LLMs). We embarked on an intricate process of fine-tuning LLMs using the Transformers library, employing synthetic conversational trees to simulate educational dialogues. This was achieved through extensive experimentation in Google CoLab, where we harnessed its computational resources to iterate and refine our models. The project culminated in a comprehensive framework that outlined the practical applications of LLMs in pedagogical settings, aiming to elevate student engagement, facilitate deeper understanding, and foster critical thinking skills.</p>

            <!-- Project 3: Diatom Dive -->
            <li>
                <h3>Diatom Dive (iOS App)</h3>
                <p>Diatom Dive represents my foray into the intersection of technology and environmental science, culminating in the creation of an iOS application dedicated to promoting public engagement with aquatic ecosystems. This project was driven by a passion to utilize technology for environmental stewardship, focusing on the role of diatoms as indicators of water health. The development process involved a user-centric design approach, employing Figma for prototyping and Xcode for implementation. Key features of the app included secure user authentication via Firebase and Google Auth, a dynamic and interactive map for exploring local water bodies, and a comprehensive database for diatom documentation. By gamifying the data collection process and integrating educational resources, Diatom Dive aims to enhance public scientific literacy and encourage proactive participation in environmental conservation efforts.</p>
